# FashionSwap - Sustainable P2P Fashion Platform

**Next-Gen Payments + Mobile-First dApp**

FashionSwap is a decentralized fashion rental and swap platform built on Starknet, enabling peer-to-peer fashion sharing with ultra-low fees powered by Chipi Pay integration.

## Problem Statement

## Smart Contract Architecture

### FashionItemNFT

NFT contract representing each clothing item with:
- Metadata: name, brand, category, size, color, condition
- Rental statistics: total rentals, revenue, days rented
- Rating system: 5-star reviews
- Carbon footprint tracking

**Key Functions:**
- `mint_fashion_item()` - Create new fashion NFT
- `list_item()` / `unlist_item()` - Control marketplace availability
- `rate_item()` - Leave review after rental
- `update_rental_stats()` - Called by marketplace on rental completion

### RentalMarketplace

Core marketplace logic for rentals and swaps:
- Rental listings with customizable terms
- Swap listings with preference matching
- Active rental tracking
- Security deposit management

**Key Functions:**
- `list_for_rent()` - List item with daily price
- `rent_item()` - Initiate rental with payment
- `end_rental()` - Complete rental, return deposit
- `propose_swap()` / `accept_swap()` - P2P swapping

### PaymentHandler

Chipi Pay integration for seamless payments:
- Escrow system for rental security
- Micro-payment optimization (<$10)
- Ultra-low fee structure (0.5% - 1.5%)
- Automated settlements

**Key Functions:**
- `create_rental_payment()` - Escrow rental + deposit
- `process_micro_payment()` - Instant small payments
- `release_payment()` - Complete transaction
- `return_deposit()` - Refund security deposit

## Chipi Pay Integration

FashionSwap leverages Chipi Pay for:

1. **Micro-Payments**: Daily rentals as low as $1
2. **Mobile UX**: QR code scanning for instant checkout
3. **Low Fees**: 0.5% for transactions under $10
4. **Fast Settlement**: Immediate fund availability

### Payment Flow

```
User initiates rental
    ↓
PaymentHandler creates escrow (rental + deposit)
    ↓
Chipi Pay processes payment
    ↓
NFT access granted to renter
    ↓
Rental period ends
    ↓
PaymentHandler releases funds to owner
    ↓
Deposit returned to renter (if no issues)
```

## Environmental Impact

### Carbon Savings Calculation

Each rental saves approximately **2kg CO2** per day compared to buying new.

**Example:**
- Rent a dress for 3 days = 6kg CO2 saved
- 100 rentals/month = 600kg CO2 saved
- 1 year = 7.2 tons CO2 saved (equivalent to ~30,000 km driving)

### Platform Metrics (Target)

- **10,000 items** listed in first month
- **50,000 rentals** in first quarter
- **100 tons CO2** saved in first year
