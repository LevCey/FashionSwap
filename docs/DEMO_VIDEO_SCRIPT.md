# FashionSwap - Demo Video Script (3 Minutes)

**Target Duration**: 2:45 - 3:00 minutes
**Hackathon**: Starknet Resolve (October 2025)
**Tracks**: Next-Gen Payments (Chipi Pay) + Mobile-First dApps

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Screen: Title Card with Logo]**

**Voiceover**:
*"The fashion industry produces 92 million tons of textile waste every year. The average person wears an item only 7 times before throwing it away. What if we could change that?"*

**[Transition: FashionSwap App Home Screen]**

*"Meet FashionSwap - the sustainable fashion platform built on Starknet, powered by Chipi Pay."*

---

## Problem Statement (0:20 - 0:40)

**[Screen: Infographic showing environmental impact]**

**Voiceover**:
*"Fast fashion is destroying our planet. But your closet is full of clothes you never wear. Others are buying new items they'll only need for a day."*

**[Screen: Split screen - full closet vs. someone buying new clothes]**

*"FashionSwap solves both problems by creating a peer-to-peer fashion rental marketplace."*

---

## Solution Overview (0:40 - 1:10)

**[Screen: App walkthrough - Home screen]**

**Voiceover**:
*"Browse thousands of fashion items from local owners. Find the perfect dress for your event, rent it for just a few dollars per day, and return it when you're done."*

**[Screen: Show item detail with pricing]**

*"See that designer dress? Buy it new: $200. Rent it on FashionSwap for 3 days: just $15."*

**[Screen: Payment screen with Chipi Pay]**

*"Thanks to Chipi Pay integration, our transaction fees are 95% lower than traditional platforms. A $5 rental costs just 2.5 cents in fees - making micro-payments actually profitable."*

## Technical Demo (1:10 - 2:00)

### Smart Contracts (1:10 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Code editor showing contracts]**

**Voiceover**:
*"FashionSwap is built on three core smart contracts in Cairo:"*

**[Show FashionItemNFT.cairo]**

*"First, FashionItemNFT - Each clothing item is an NFT with rich metadata: brand, size, condition, and even tracks carbon footprint savings."*

**[Show RentalMarketplace.cairo]**

*"Second, RentalMarketplace - Handles all rental listings, peer-to-peer swaps, and security deposits with built-in escrow protection."*

**[Show PaymentHandler.cairo]**

*"Third, PaymentHandler - Our Chipi Pay integration enabling ultra-low-cost micro-payments with fees as low as 0.5%."*

### Mobile App (1:30 - 2:00)

**[Screen: Mobile app demo]**

**Voiceover**:
*"Our React Native mobile app provides a seamless experience:"*

**[Show browsing items]**

*"Browse items with Instagram-style feeds..."*

**[Show rental flow]**

*"Select your rental period..."*

**[Show Chipi Pay checkout]**

*"Pay instantly with Chipi Pay - no friction, no high fees..."*

**[Show confirmation screen]**

*"And you're done! The owner gets notified, and your rental is confirmed."*

## Impact & Features (2:00 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Carbon tracker animation]**

**Voiceover**:
*"Every rental saves an average of 2 kilograms of CO2 per day. FashionSwap tracks your environmental impact in real-time."*

**[Screen: User profile showing stats]**

*"See your total carbon savings, earnings from renting out your items, and build your reputation through ratings."*

**[Screen: P2P swap feature]**

*"Want to swap instead of rent? Our P2P swap feature lets you exchange items with zero platform fees."*

**[Screen: Community feed]**

*"Join a community of conscious consumers making sustainable fashion choices."*

## Market Opportunity (2:30 - 2:45)

**[Screen: Market statistics]**

**Voiceover**:
*"The fashion rental market is growing at 15% annually, expected to reach $2.5 billion by 2028. But traditional platforms can't profitably serve daily micro-rentals."*

**[Screen: Comparison chart - FashionSwap vs competitors]**

*"Chipi Pay changes everything. Where Rent the Runway charges 15-20% fees, we charge just 0.5-1.5%. This is only possible on Starknet with Chipi Pay."*
